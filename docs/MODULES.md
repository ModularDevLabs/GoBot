# Module Guide

This document explains how each GoBot feature module behaves at runtime, how to configure it, and how modules interact.

For field-by-field definitions and defaults, see `docs/SETTINGS.md`.

## How Modules Are Enabled

- All feature modules are controlled by `feature_flags` in guild settings.
- Every module defaults to `disabled` on a new guild.
- Most modules no-op immediately when disabled.
- Core tracking/action systems (activity tracking, backfill, action worker, quarantine provisioning) are always available because other modules depend on them.

## Core Systems

### Activity Tracking (core)

- Trigger: every non-bot `MESSAGE_CREATE` in a guild.
- Behavior:
- Runs module handlers (appeals, suggestions, tickets, verification, leveling, keyword alerts, AFK, custom commands/automod).
- Upserts `activity` only when stale relative to inactive cutoff (`inactive_days`), reducing write pressure.
- Data written: `last_message_at`, `last_channel_id`, username/display snapshots.
- Config keys: `inactive_days`.

### Backfill (core)

- Trigger: dashboard `POST /api/backfill/start`.
- Behavior:
- Scans channels for historical messages and seeds/reconciles activity data.
- Effective scan window is `max(backfill_days, inactive_days)`.
- Uses per-channel saved state so reruns continue efficiently.
- Marks inaccessible channels as skipped, not hard failure.
- Status values: `queued`, `running`, `success`, `partial`, `failed`.
- Config keys: `backfill_days`, `backfill_concurrency`, `backfill_include_types`.

### Action Queue (core)

- Trigger: dashboard actions, warnings thresholds, automod quarantine mode, anti-raid quarantine mode, account-age guard actions.
- Behavior:
- Queues actions as `quarantine`, `kick`, or `remove_roles`.
- Worker executes oldest queued action, updates `running/success/failed`, and emits audit events for success/failure.
- Enforces `admin_user_policy` for administrator targets.
- Config keys: `admin_user_policy`, quarantine-related settings.

### Quarantine Assets + Permissions (core)

- Trigger: startup/guild provisioning and quarantine execution.
- Behavior:
- Ensures role `Quarantined` and channel `quarantine-readme` exist (or uses configured IDs).
- Ensures readme channel overwrite (view/read allowed, send denied for quarantine role).
- If `safe_quarantine_mode=false`, attempts guild-wide deny-view overwrites for quarantine role (best effort).
- During quarantine action, assigns quarantine role and removes other roles except allowlist.
- Config keys: `quarantine_role_id`, `readme_channel_id`, `allowlist_role_ids`, `safe_quarantine_mode`.

## Feature Modules

### Message Retention Tooling (settings-driven)

- Trigger: background worker tick every 6 hours.
- Behavior:
- Reads guild `retention_days`.
- If `retention_days > 0`, computes cutoff (`now - retention_days`).
- Optionally records `retention_archive` action summary with row counts.
- Purges old records from `warnings`, `ticket_messages`, `appeals`, `suggestions`, `member_notes`, `reminders`, and `actions`.
- Config keys: `retention_days`, `retention_archive_before_purge`.

### Incident Mode Switch (settings-driven)

- Trigger: enabled from Settings view.
- Behavior:
- Shows an incident banner in dashboard.
- Adds stricter safety checks for destructive actions:
- Confirm token required.
- Distinct approver required for `kick` and `remove_roles`.
- Optional auto-disable timestamp can end incident mode automatically.

- If matched, AutoMod is skipped for that message.
- Config keys: feature flag only; commands managed via custom-command records.

## Cross-Module Interactions

- `custom_commands` runs before `automod`; successful command responses bypass automod checks.
- `anti_raid` and `account_age_guard` can enqueue actions into the same queue used by dashboard moderation.
- `warnings` threshold actions use the same queue and same `admin_user_policy` behavior.
- `verification` and `anti_raid (verification_only)` both rely on `unverified_role_id`.
- `audit_log_stream` can include outcomes from actions and automod for centralized observability.

## Operational Advice

- Enable modules gradually per guild, beginning with logging modules first (`audit_log_stream`, `invite_tracker`) to validate permissions.
- For action modules (`automod`, `warnings`, `anti_raid`, `account_age_guard`), confirm role hierarchy and dry-run in a test guild.
- Keep `backfill_concurrency` conservative (1-3) if you see API 429 behavior.
- Use dedicated log channels for warnings, tickets, suggestions, appeals, and account-age events to keep moderation trails auditable.
